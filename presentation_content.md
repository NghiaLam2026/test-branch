Data Mining - Fall 2025

---

## 🧭 2. Problem Statement / Motivation

**Why This Matters:**
- NYC inspects **thousands of restaurants** each year, assigning **A/B/C grades** to protect public health
- **21,165 unique restaurants** with **83,603 inspections** in our dataset
- Can we identify **high-risk restaurants before inspectors visit**?

**Research Question:**
- Can we predict inspection grades using **only pre-inspection information**?
- What patterns exist in restaurant violations across **geography, cuisine, and time**?
- How well can models perform **without data leakage** from inspection results?

**Challenge:**
- Most predictive features (SCORE, violations) are **post-inspection** → would create unrealistic predictions
- Need to use only information available **before the inspection occurs**

## 🧹 4. Data Cleaning Steps

**1. Duplicate Removal**
- Removed exact duplicate rows (0 duplicates found)

**2. Data Type Conversion**
- Converted date columns to datetime: INSPECTION DATE, GRADE DATE, RECORD DATE
- Converted ZIPCODE to string (preserve leading zeros)
- Set categorical types: BORO, CUISINE DESCRIPTION, INSPECTION TYPE, GRADE

**3. Missing Value Handling**
- Dropped 50 rows with missing SCORE (required for analysis)
- Dropped 19,773 rows with non-A/B/C grades (simplified classification)

**4. Feature Engineering**
- Extracted INSPECTION_YEAR and INSPECTION_MONTH from INSPECTION DATE
- Final dataset: **83,603 rows** ready for modeling

**5. Data Quality Checks**
- Verified geographic coordinates (Latitude/Longitude) are valid
- Ensured chronological order per restaurant
- Validated grade assignments match score ranges

## 🧱 6. Feature Engineering

### Final Feature Set (6 Pre-Inspection Features):

**1. Geographic Features:**
- **Latitude** - North-south location in NYC
- **Longitude** - East-west location in NYC
- **BORO** (categorical) - Borough (Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, Staten Island)

**2. Restaurant Characteristics:**
- **CUISINE DESCRIPTION** (categorical) - Type of cuisine served

**3. Temporal Features:**
- **INSPECTION_YEAR** - Year of inspection (2012-2023)
- **INSPECTION_MONTH** - Month of inspection (1-12)

### Why These Features?

✅ **Pre-inspection:** All known before inspection occurs  
✅ **Non-leaky:** Don't contain inspection results  
✅ **Interpretable:** Make business sense  
✅ **Predictive:** Capture geographic, operational, and temporal patterns

### Features Excluded (Post-Inspection):

❌ **SCORE** - Directly determines GRADE (data leakage)  
❌ **HAS_VIOLATION** - Derived from SCORE  
❌ **CRITICAL_BINARY** - Inspection result  
❌ **VIOLATION CODE/DESCRIPTION** - Determined during inspection  
❌ **INSPECTION TYPE** - Can leak information about outcome

### Feature Selection Rationale:

- **Geographic features** capture neighborhood effects, socioeconomic patterns, inspector behavior
- **Cuisine type** reflects operational complexity and food safety requirements
- **Temporal features** capture policy changes, seasonality, and long-term trends

## 🤖 7. Modeling Approach

### Models Used:

**1. Logistic Regression (Baseline)**
- **Type:** Multinomial logistic regression
- **Why:** Linear baseline, interpretable coefficients
- **Configuration:** 
  - Multi-class classification
  - Class weight balancing
  - LBFGS solver

**2. Random Forest**
- **Type:** Ensemble of decision trees
- **Why:** Handles non-linear patterns, geographic partitions
- **Configuration:**
  - 300 estimators
  - Class weight balancing
  - Handles mixed feature types well

**3. XGBoost**
- **Type:** Gradient boosting
- **Why:** Powerful for tabular data, handles imbalance
- **Configuration:**
  - 300 estimators
  - Max depth: 4
  - Learning rate: 0.1
  - Sample weights for class imbalance

### Model Selection Rationale:

- **Logistic Regression:** Simple baseline, shows linear relationships
- **Random Forest:** Captures complex geographic and categorical interactions
- **XGBoost:** State-of-the-art gradient boosting, good for imbalanced data

### Evaluation Strategy:

- **Grouped train-test split (70/30)** by restaurant ID
- Prevents data leakage (same restaurant in both sets)
- **21,165 unique restaurants**
- **Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score (weighted)

## 📊 8. Results & Evaluation

### Model Performance Comparison (Test Set):

| Model | Train Accuracy | Test Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|-------|---------------|---------------|-----------|--------|----------|
| **Logistic Regression** | ~0.48 | **0.482** | 0.48 | 0.48 | 0.48 |
| **XGBoost** | 0.673 | **0.576** | 0.75 | 0.58 | 0.64 |
| **Random Forest** | 0.999 | **0.801** | 0.71 | 0.80 | 0.74 |

### Key Observations:

**1. Random Forest Performs Best**
- **80.1% test accuracy** - highest among all models
- Captures non-linear geographic and categorical patterns
- Handles feature interactions well

**2. Class Imbalance Challenge**
- Models struggle with **B and C classes** (rare)
- Most predictions default to **Grade A** (majority class)
- This is **expected** given:
  - Only static pre-inspection features
  - No historical behavior data
  - Severe class imbalance (82% A)

**3. Overfitting in Random Forest**
- Train accuracy: 99.9% (near-perfect)
- Test accuracy: 80.1% (good but lower)
- Suggests model memorizes some patterns but generalizes reasonably

**4. Logistic Regression Baseline**
- Lowest performance (48.2%)
- Shows that **non-linear relationships** are important
- Linear model insufficient for this problem

### Confusion Matrix Insights:

- **Random Forest:** Best at predicting A, struggles with B/C
- **XGBoost:** Better precision for A, but lower recall
- **Logistic Regression:** Poor performance across all classes

### Interpretation:

✅ **Results make sense:**
- Geographic and temporal patterns are predictive
- Without historical data, predicting rare classes (B/C) is extremely difficult
- Tree-based models outperform linear models (non-linear patterns exist)
- 80% accuracy is **good** given only pre-inspection features

## 🚧 10. Limitations

### Acknowledged Constraints:

**1. Static Features Only**
- No historical behavior (previous scores, grades, violation history)
- Cannot capture restaurant improvement/decline trends
- Missing key predictive signal

**2. Severe Class Imbalance**
- **82% Grade A** makes B/C prediction extremely difficult
- Models default to majority class
- Would need specialized techniques (SMOTE, cost-sensitive learning)

**3. Limited Feature Set**
- Only 6 features (geographic, cuisine, temporal)
- Missing potentially useful features:
  - Restaurant age
  - Previous inspection history
  - Neighborhood demographics
  - Violation type patterns

**4. Inspection Date Selection Bias**
- Inspection dates reflect policy, not restaurant behavior
- Some restaurants inspected more frequently
- Temporal patterns may reflect policy changes, not restaurant quality

**5. Population-Level Predictions**
- Models predict **trends**, not individual restaurant outcomes
- Geographic patterns dominate
- Less useful for specific restaurant prediction

**6. No Text Analysis**
- Violation descriptions not analyzed (NLP potential)
- Could extract violation type patterns
- Rich text data unused

**7. Grouped Split Limitations**
- Prevents same restaurant in train/test
- But doesn't account for temporal ordering
- Could use time-based splits for more realistic evaluation

**8. Model Interpretability**
- Random Forest is less interpretable than linear models
- Feature importance available but not deep interpretation
- Trade-off between performance and explainability
