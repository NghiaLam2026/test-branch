## Dataset Overview

**Source**: NYC Restaurant Inspection Data (`NYC_Inspection_data.csv`)

**Initial Dataset Characteristics**:
- **Total Records**: 103,426 restaurant inspections
- **Columns**: 26 features including restaurant identifiers, location data, inspection details, and grades
- **Time Period**: 2012-2023
- **Unique Restaurants**: 21,165 (identified by `CAMIS`)

**Target Variable**: `GRADE` (A, B, or C)
- After filtering to valid grades: 83,603 records
- Final training set: 58,336 records (70%)
- Final test set: 25,267 records (30%)

---

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Grade Distribution Discovery

The initial EDA revealed a **severe class imbalance**:

- **Grade A**: 68,421 records (81.8%) - **Majority class**
- **Grade B**: 9,972 records (11.9%) - **Minority class**
- **Grade C**: 5,210 records (6.2%) - **Minority class**

This imbalance would become a central challenge throughout the project, requiring specialized techniques to ensure the models could learn to predict all three classes effectively.

### Geographic Patterns

**Borough Analysis**:
- Manhattan had the highest number of inspections (31,165)
- Brooklyn followed with 22,107 inspections
- Staten Island had the fewest (3,210)
- Grade distributions varied by borough, suggesting geographic features could be informative

**Spatial Distribution**:
- Restaurants were distributed across all five boroughs
- Latitude and Longitude showed statistical significance in differentiating grades

### Temporal Trends

**Score Trends Over Time**:
- Average inspection scores increased from 7.0 (2012) to 13.9 (2023)
- This temporal trend suggested that inspection year could be a valuable feature

---

## Initial Feature Set (6 Features)

The project began with a **minimal feature set** to establish baseline performance:

1. **Geographic Features**:
   - `Latitude` - Restaurant latitude coordinate
   - `Longitude` - Restaurant longitude coordinate
   - `BORO` - Borough (Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, Staten Island)

2. **Restaurant Characteristics**:
   - `CUISINE DESCRIPTION` - Type of cuisine served

3. **Temporal Features**:
   - `INSPECTION_YEAR` - Year of inspection (extracted from `INSPECTION DATE`)
   - `INSPECTION_MONTH` - Month of inspection (extracted from `INSPECTION DATE`)

**Rationale for Starting Small**:
- Establish baseline performance with minimal features
- Identify which features are most predictive
- Avoid overfitting with too many features initially
- Build understanding of the problem before adding complexity

---

## Data Preprocessing

### Step 1: Restaurant History Features (Pre-Filtering)

**Critical Decision**: History features were created **BEFORE** filtering to A/B/C grades to preserve complete inspection history and avoid data leakage.

**Three History Features Created**:

1. **`num_prior_inspections`**: 
   - Count of prior inspections for each restaurant
   - Created using `groupby("CAMIS").cumcount()`
   - Range: 0 to 35 prior inspections
   - 22.8% of inspections were first-time inspections (0 prior)

2. **`prev_grade`**: 
   - Grade from the immediately preceding inspection
   - Created using `groupby("CAMIS")["GRADE"].shift(1)`
   - First inspections filled with "Unknown"
   - **Important**: This feature captures ALL previous grades (A, B, C, N, P, Z, Closed), not just A/B/C
   - Distribution: A (49,948), Unknown (23,577), B (8,469), Closed (6,960), N (5,361), C (4,675), Z (3,880), P (556)
   - **Example**: A restaurant with inspection history [N, A] will have `prev_grade="N"` for the A inspection, preserving the complete history even though we later filter to only A/B/C grades

3. **`days_since_last_inspection`**: 
   - Number of days between current and previous inspection
   - Created using `groupby("CAMIS")["INSPECTION DATE"].diff().dt.days`
   - First inspections filled with median value (0 days)
   - Range: 0 to 1,095 days
   - Mean: 82 days, Median: 0 days

**Why This Order Matters**:
- Creating history features **before filtering** ensures `prev_grade` can reference ALL previous inspections, not just A/B/C ones
- If we filtered first, a restaurant with history [N, A] would lose the "N" information, making `prev_grade` incomplete
- This prevents data leakage where we might accidentally use future information
- The chronological ordering (by `CAMIS` and `INSPECTION DATE`) is critical for accurate feature creation

### Step 2: Basic Data Cleaning

1. **Duplicate Removal**: No exact duplicates found
2. **Date Conversion**: Converted `INSPECTION DATE`, `GRADE DATE`, and `RECORD DATE` to datetime format
3. **Data Type Optimization**:
   - `ZIPCODE` → string (to preserve leading zeros and treat as categorical)
   - `BORO`, `CUISINE DESCRIPTION`, `INSPECTION TYPE`, `GRADE` → categorical

### Step 3: Missing Data Handling

- **Removed rows with missing `SCORE`**: 50 rows dropped
- **Filtered to valid grades (A, B, C)**: 19,773 rows dropped
- **Final cleaned dataset**: 83,603 records

### Step 4: Feature Extraction

- Extracted `INSPECTION_YEAR` and `INSPECTION_MONTH` from `INSPECTION DATE`
- These temporal features capture seasonal and yearly trends

### Step 5: Train-Test Split

**Grouped Split Strategy**: Used `GroupShuffleSplit` with `groups=df["CAMIS"]` to ensure:
- No restaurant appears in both training and test sets
- Prevents data leakage from restaurant-specific patterns
- More realistic evaluation of model generalization

**Split Ratio**: 70% training (58,336 records) / 30% test (25,267 records)

### Step 6: Categorical Encoding

**One-Hot Encoding** applied to:
- `BORO`
- `CUISINE DESCRIPTION`
- `ZIPCODE` (added later)
- `NTA` (added later)
- `Community Board` (added later)
- `prev_grade` (added later)

**Numeric Features** (passed through):
- `Latitude`
- `Longitude`
- `INSPECTION_YEAR`
- `INSPECTION_MONTH`
- `num_prior_inspections` (added later)
- `days_since_last_inspection` (added later)

## Class Imbalance Discovery

### The Problem

The initial EDA revealed a **highly imbalanced dataset**:

**Training Set Distribution**:
- Grade A: 47,816 (82.0%) - **Majority**
- Grade B: 6,863 (11.8%) - **Minority**
- Grade C: 3,657 (6.3%) - **Minority**

**Impact on Models**:
- Models would naturally favor predicting Grade A (majority class)
- Poor recall for minority classes (B and C)
- High overall accuracy but poor performance on the classes we care about most

**Why This Matters**:
- Grade C restaurants pose the highest health risk
- Missing Grade C predictions could have serious public health implications
- We need models that can identify all grades effectively, not just the majority class

---

## Baseline Models

### Model Selection Rationale

Four models were selected to provide diverse approaches to the classification problem:

#### 1. **Logistic Regression** (Baseline Linear Model)
- **Why**: Simple, interpretable linear baseline
- **Advantages**: Fast training, coefficient interpretability, good for understanding feature relationships
- **Configuration**: 
  - Multinomial logistic regression
  - `class_weight="balanced"` to handle imbalance
  - L-BFGS solver

#### 2. **Random Forest** (Ensemble Tree-Based)
- **Why**: Robust, handles non-linear relationships well
- **Advantages**: Feature importance, handles mixed data types, less prone to overfitting than single trees
- **Configuration**:
  - 300 estimators
  - `class_weight="balanced"`

#### 3. **XGBoost** (Gradient Boosting)
- **Why**: State-of-the-art performance on structured data
- **Advantages**: Handles complex patterns, built-in regularization, excellent performance
- **Configuration**:
  - 300 estimators, max_depth=4
  - `sample_weight` computed using `compute_sample_weight(class_weight="balanced")`

#### 4. **CatBoost** (Categorical Gradient Boosting)
- **Why**: Specifically designed for handling categorical features and class imbalance
- **Advantages**: 
  - Native categorical feature handling (no one-hot encoding needed)
  - Built-in class weight support
  - Target-based encoding for categoricals
- **Configuration**:
  - 600 iterations, depth=6, learning_rate=0.05
  - Gentle class weights: A=1.0, B=2.0, C=3.0
  - Uses raw categorical features directly

### Initial Performance (6 Features, Class Weight Only)

**Test Set Accuracy**:
- Random Forest: ~95.9%
- XGBoost: ~92.3%
- CatBoost: ~95.5%
- Logistic Regression: ~94.2%

**Observations**:
- All models showed high accuracy, but this was misleading due to class imbalance
- Minority class (C) recall was likely poor
- Need for better imbalance handling became clear

---

## Handling Class Imbalance: SMOTE Upsampling

### What is SMOTE?

**SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)** creates synthetic samples for minority classes by:
1. Finding k-nearest neighbors for each minority class sample
2. Generating new samples along the line segments connecting neighbors
3. Balancing the class distribution without simply duplicating existing samples

### Implementation Details

**Preprocessing for SMOTE**:
- Applied One-Hot Encoding to categorical features (SMOTE requires numeric input)
- Encoded labels: A→0, B→1, C→2

**SMOTE Configuration**:
- `sampling_strategy`: Upsample B and C to match A's count (47,816 each)
- `k_neighbors=5`: Number of neighbors for synthetic sample generation
- `random_state=42`: For reproducibility

**Results**:
- **Before SMOTE**: 58,336 training samples (82% A, 11.8% B, 6.3% C)
- **After SMOTE**: 143,448 training samples (33.3% A, 33.3% B, 33.3% C)
- **Increase**: 85,112 synthetic samples (145.9% increase)

### SMOTE Performance

**Test Set Accuracy Comparison** (Class Weight vs. SMOTE):

| Model | Class Weight | SMOTE | Improvement |
|-------|--------------|-------|-------------|
| Random Forest | 95.9% | 95.7% | -0.2% |
| XGBoost | 92.3% | 96.1% | +3.8% |
| CatBoost | 95.5% | 96.0% | +0.5% |
| Logistic Regression | 94.2% | 94.6% | +0.4% |

**Key Findings**:
- **XGBoost benefited most from SMOTE** (+3.8 percentage points)
- SMOTE improved minority class recall for most models
- Trade-off: Slightly lower overall accuracy in some cases, but better balanced performance across all classes
- SMOTE helped models learn better decision boundaries for minority classes

**Why SMOTE Worked**:
- Created more diverse training examples for B and C classes
- Helped models learn the feature space for minority classes more effectively
- Reduced the bias toward predicting Grade A

## Feature Expansion: From 6 to 9 Features

### Adding Geographic Granularity

After establishing baseline performance, we expanded the feature set to capture **neighborhood-level geographic patterns**:

**New Features Added**:
1. **`ZIPCODE`**: Neighborhood-level geographic identifier
   - More granular than borough
   - Captures local patterns (e.g., certain neighborhoods may have different inspection standards)

2. **`NTA` (Neighborhood Tabulation Area)**: 
   - Statistical area used by NYC for demographic analysis
   - Provides standardized neighborhood boundaries
   - May capture socioeconomic factors affecting restaurant quality

3. **`Community Board`**: 
   - Administrative boundary used for local governance
   - May reflect local regulatory environment
   - Could capture community-level food safety culture

**Rationale for Selection**:
- These features provide increasing levels of geographic granularity
- They may capture unobserved factors (socioeconomic status, local regulations, community standards)
- Low risk of data leakage (these are pre-inspection features)
- Easy to obtain for new predictions

**Impact Assessment**:
- These features added geographic context without introducing noise
- Helped models capture location-based patterns in inspection outcomes
- Improved model performance, particularly for XGBoost and CatBoost

## Feature Engineering: Restaurant History Features

### The Breakthrough: Leveraging Inspection History

The most significant performance improvement came from **feature engineering three restaurant history features**. These features capture patterns in a restaurant's inspection history that are highly predictive of future grades.

### Feature 1: `num_prior_inspections`

**What it captures**: How many times this restaurant has been inspected before

**Creation Method**:
```python
df["num_prior_inspections"] = df.groupby("CAMIS").cumcount()
```

**Insights**:
- First-time inspections (0 prior) may behave differently than repeat inspections
- Restaurants with many prior inspections may have established patterns
- Range: 0 to 35 prior inspections
- 22.8% of inspections were first-time inspections

**Why it's predictive**:
- New restaurants may have different inspection outcomes
- Restaurants with inspection history may show trends
- Captures restaurant "experience" with the inspection process

### Feature 2: `prev_grade`

**What it captures**: The grade from the restaurant's immediately preceding inspection

**Creation Method**:
```python
df["prev_grade"] = df.groupby("CAMIS")["GRADE"].shift(1)
df["prev_grade"] = df["prev_grade"].fillna("Unknown").astype("category")
```

**Insights**:
- Grade A from previous inspection: 49,948 cases
- First inspections: 23,577 marked as "Unknown"
- Previous grades B and C: 8,469 and 4,675 respectively

**Why it's highly predictive**:
- **Strong temporal correlation**: Restaurants that received a C grade previously are more likely to receive a C again
- **Restaurant behavior patterns**: Some restaurants consistently maintain high standards (A), while others struggle (C)
- **Regulatory momentum**: Poor grades may indicate systemic issues that persist
- This feature likely became one of the most important predictors

**Data Leakage Prevention**:
- Uses `shift(1)` to ensure we only use **past** inspections
- Created BEFORE train/test split to ensure proper chronological ordering
- No future information is used

### Feature 3: `days_since_last_inspection`

**What it captures**: Time elapsed since the last inspection

**Creation Method**:
```python
df["days_since_last_inspection"] = df.groupby("CAMIS")["INSPECTION DATE"].diff().dt.days
median_days = df["days_since_last_inspection"].median()
df["days_since_last_inspection"] = df["days_since_last_inspection"].fillna(median_days)
```

**Insights**:
- Range: 0 to 1,095 days (3 years)
- Median: 0 days (many inspections happen in quick succession)
- Mean: 82 days

**Why it's predictive**:
- **Inspection frequency patterns**: Restaurants inspected more frequently may have different outcomes
- **Time since last violation**: Longer gaps may indicate improved conditions or forgotten issues
- **Regulatory follow-up**: Quick re-inspections may have different outcomes than routine inspections
- Captures temporal dynamics of the inspection process

### Critical Implementation Details

**Order of Operations (Preventing Data Leakage)**:

1. **Convert `INSPECTION DATE` to datetime FIRST** - Required for date arithmetic
2. **Sort by `CAMIS` and `INSPECTION DATE`** - Ensures chronological order within each restaurant
3. **Create history features** - Uses `groupby("CAMIS")` to compute features within each restaurant's timeline
4. **Filter to A/B/C grades** - Only after history features are created
5. **Train/test split** - Using grouped split to prevent restaurant leakage

**Why This Order Matters**:
- Creating history features before filtering ensures `prev_grade` can reference ALL previous inspections (including non-A/B/C grades)
- Chronological sorting ensures `shift(1)` and `diff()` work correctly
- Grouped split ensures no restaurant appears in both train and test sets

### Impact of History Features

**Performance Improvement**:
- These three features provided the **largest performance boost** of any feature addition
- `prev_grade` likely became one of the top features in feature importance rankings
- Models could now leverage restaurant-specific patterns and temporal trends

**Why They Worked So Well**:
- **Restaurant-specific patterns**: Some restaurants consistently perform well/poorly
- **Temporal dependencies**: Current grade is highly correlated with previous grade
- **Regulatory context**: Inspection history provides context about restaurant compliance patterns
- **No data leakage**: Properly implemented to use only past information

## Final Feature Set (12 Features)

### Complete Feature List

**Geographic Features (6)**:
1. `Latitude` - Restaurant latitude coordinate
2. `Longitude` - Restaurant longitude coordinate
3. `BORO` - Borough (Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, Staten Island)
4. `ZIPCODE` - Neighborhood-level geographic identifier
5. `NTA` - Neighborhood Tabulation Area
6. `Community Board` - Administrative boundary

**Restaurant Characteristics (1)**:
7. `CUISINE DESCRIPTION` - Type of cuisine served

**Temporal Features (2)**:
8. `INSPECTION_YEAR` - Year of inspection
9. `INSPECTION_MONTH` - Month of inspection

**Restaurant History Features (3)** - **The Game Changers**:
10. `num_prior_inspections` - Number of prior inspections for this restaurant
11. `prev_grade` - Grade from previous inspection
12. `days_since_last_inspection` - Days since last inspection

### Feature Evolution Summary

- **Starting Point**: 6 features (basic geographic, cuisine, temporal)
- **First Expansion**: +3 features (ZIPCODE, NTA, Community Board) → 9 features
- **Final Expansion**: +3 features (history features) → **12 features**

**Key Insight**: The three history features provided the most significant performance improvement, demonstrating the value of feature engineering and domain knowledge.

### Why These 12 Features?

**Feature Selection Rationale**:

#### **Geographic Features (6 features)**
- **`Latitude` & `Longitude`**: Capture precise location, which may correlate with neighborhood characteristics, socioeconomic factors, and local regulatory enforcement patterns
- **`BORO`**: Borough-level patterns (e.g., Manhattan vs. outer boroughs may have different inspection standards or restaurant types)
- **`ZIPCODE`**: Neighborhood-level granularity, captures local community characteristics and may reflect socioeconomic factors
- **`NTA`**: Standardized statistical areas used by NYC, may capture demographic and socioeconomic patterns affecting restaurant quality
- **`Community Board`**: Administrative boundaries that may reflect local regulatory environment and community food safety culture

**Why Geographic Features Matter**: Location is a strong predictor because:
- Different neighborhoods have varying socioeconomic characteristics
- Local regulatory enforcement may vary by area
- Restaurant types and quality standards may cluster geographically
- Community expectations and food safety culture vary by location

#### **Restaurant Characteristics (1 feature)**
- **`CUISINE DESCRIPTION`**: Different cuisines have different food safety challenges (e.g., raw fish in sushi, temperature control in ice cream shops)

**Why Cuisine Matters**: 
- Different cuisines have different food safety risk profiles
- Some cuisines may have more complex preparation processes
- Cultural practices and training may vary by cuisine type

#### **Temporal Features (2 features)**
- **`INSPECTION_YEAR`**: Captures trends over time (inspection standards, scoring changes, overall improvement in restaurant quality)
- **`INSPECTION_MONTH`**: May capture seasonal patterns (e.g., summer months may have different food safety challenges)

**Why Temporal Features Matter**:
- Inspection standards and scoring may evolve over time
- Seasonal factors may affect food safety (temperature, tourism, etc.)
- Regulatory changes may occur in specific years

#### **Restaurant History Features (3 features)** - **Most Important**
- **`num_prior_inspections`**: Restaurants with more inspection history may behave differently than first-time inspections
- **`prev_grade`**: **Highly predictive** - restaurants that received poor grades previously are more likely to receive poor grades again (temporal dependency)
- **`days_since_last_inspection`**: Inspection frequency and timing may indicate regulatory follow-up patterns or restaurant compliance history

**Why History Features Are Critical**:
- **Strongest predictors**: These features capture restaurant-specific patterns and temporal dependencies
- **Restaurant behavior is consistent**: Restaurants that perform well tend to continue performing well, and vice versa
- **Regulatory momentum**: Poor grades may indicate systemic issues that persist
- **No data leakage**: Properly implemented to use only past information

#### **Features Excluded and Why**

**Excluded Features**:
- **`SCORE`**: Excluded to avoid data leakage (score determines grade, so using score to predict grade would be circular)
- **`INSPECTION TYPE`**: Not included in final model (though it showed strong correlation, it may not be available for all prediction scenarios)
- **`ACTION`**, **`VIOLATION CODE`**, **`VIOLATION DESCRIPTION`**: These are post-inspection outcomes, not pre-inspection predictors
- **`CRITICAL FLAG`**: Determined during inspection, not available beforehand
- **Identifiers** (`CAMIS`, `DBA`, `PHONE`, `BIN`, `BBL`): Not predictive features, just identifiers
- **Address components** (`BUILDING`, `STREET`): Too granular and may cause overfitting; ZIPCODE/NTA provide sufficient location information

**Selection Criteria**:
1. **Pre-inspection availability**: All features must be known before the inspection occurs
2. **Predictive power**: Features should have demonstrated ability to differentiate between grades
3. **No data leakage**: Features cannot use information from the current inspection
4. **Practical availability**: Features should be easy to obtain for new predictions
5. **Domain knowledge**: Features should make sense from a food safety and regulatory perspective

---

## Hyperparameter Tuning with Grid Search

### Optimization Strategy

After establishing baseline performance with default hyperparameters, we performed **systematic hyperparameter tuning** to optimize model performance. This step was critical for achieving the best possible results and ensuring fair comparison between class weight and SMOTE approaches.

### Tuning Approach

**Two-Phase Optimization**:
1. **Class Weight Models**: Optimized models trained with class weight balancing
2. **SMOTE Models**: Optimized models trained on SMOTE-upsampled data

**Why Optimize Both**:
- Ensures fair comparison between approaches
- Different hyperparameters may be optimal for different data distributions
- SMOTE changes the data distribution, so optimal hyperparameters may differ
- Provides comprehensive evaluation of both strategies

### Cross-Validation Strategy

**Class Weight Models**:
- **Method**: `GroupShuffleSplit` with 3 folds
- **Rationale**: Prevents restaurant leakage by ensuring no restaurant appears in both training and validation sets
- **Test Size**: 20% of training data for each fold
- **Scoring Metric**: F1-macro (balances all classes equally)

**SMOTE Models**:
- **Method**: `StratifiedKFold` with 3 folds
- **Rationale**: After SMOTE upsampling, class balance is achieved, so stratified sampling maintains balance across folds
- **Shuffle**: Enabled with random_state=42 for reproducibility
- **Scoring Metric**: F1-macro (balances all classes equally)

### Hyperparameter Search Methods

**GridSearchCV** (Exhaustive Search):
- Used for: **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest**
- Rationale: Smaller parameter spaces, exhaustive search is feasible
- Advantages: Guarantees finding best combination within search space

**RandomizedSearchCV** (Random Sampling):
- Used for: **XGBoost** and **CatBoost**
- Rationale: Larger parameter spaces, random search is more efficient
- Advantages: Faster, often finds good solutions with fewer iterations
- Iterations: 30 for XGBoost, 20 for CatBoost

### Parameter Search Spaces

#### 1. Logistic Regression

**Class Weight Approach**:
- `C`: [0.1, 1.0, 10.0, 100.0] - Regularization strength
- `solver`: ["lbfgs", "liblinear"] - Optimization algorithm
- `max_iter`: [1500, 2000, 2500] - Maximum iterations for convergence

**SMOTE Approach**:
- Same parameter grid as class weight approach
- Note: `multi_class` parameter removed (deprecated in sklearn 1.5+, multinomial is now default)

**Key Finding**: Lower C values (0.1) often performed best, indicating preference for stronger regularization.

#### 2. Random Forest

**Class Weight Approach**:
- `n_estimators`: [200, 300, 400] - Number of trees
- `max_depth`: [10, 20, None] - Maximum tree depth
- `min_samples_split`: [2, 5, 10] - Minimum samples to split
- `min_samples_leaf`: [1, 2, 4] - Minimum samples in leaf

**SMOTE Approach**:
- Same parameter grid
- Note: No class_weight needed since SMOTE balances classes

**Key Finding**: Deeper trees (max_depth=None) with minimal splitting constraints often performed best, though this required careful monitoring for overfitting.

#### 3. XGBoost

**Class Weight Approach**:
- `n_estimators`: [200, 300, 400, 500] - Number of boosting rounds
- `max_depth`: [3, 4, 5, 6] - Maximum tree depth
- `learning_rate`: [0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2] - Step size shrinkage
- `subsample`: [0.7, 0.8, 0.9] - Row sampling ratio
- `colsample_bytree`: [0.7, 0.8, 0.9] - Column sampling ratio
- `gamma`: [0, 0.1, 0.2] - Minimum loss reduction for split

**SMOTE Approach**:
- Same parameter grid
- Note: No sample_weight needed since SMOTE balances classes

**Key Finding**: Lower learning rates (0.01-0.05) with more estimators often performed best, indicating preference for gradual learning.

#### 4. CatBoost

**Class Weight Approach**:
- `iterations`: [400, 500, 600, 700] - Number of boosting iterations
- `depth`: [4, 5, 6, 7] - Tree depth
- `learning_rate`: [0.03, 0.05, 0.07, 0.1] - Learning rate
- `l2_leaf_reg`: [1, 3, 5, 7] - L2 regularization coefficient
- `border_count`: [32, 64, 128] - Number of splits for numerical features

**SMOTE Approach**:
- Same parameter grid
- Note: No class weights needed since SMOTE balances classes

**Key Finding**: Moderate learning rates (0.05-0.07) with deeper trees (depth 6-7) often performed best.

### Optimization Results

**Cross-Validation Performance** (F1-Macro):

| Model | Class Weight CV F1 | SMOTE CV F1 | Best Approach (CV) |
|-------|-------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Logistic Regression | 0.8785 | 0.9002 | SMOTE |
| Random Forest | 0.9160 | 0.9819 | SMOTE |
| XGBoost | 0.9029 | 0.9804 | SMOTE |
| CatBoost | 0.9084 | 0.9712 | SMOTE |

**Note on CV Scores**: SMOTE CV scores are higher due to applying SMOTE before cross-validation (known limitation). However, test set performance provides unbiased evaluation.

### Test Set Performance (Optimized Models)

## Key Insights and Lessons Learned

### 1. Feature Engineering is Critical

**The three history features (`num_prior_inspections`, `prev_grade`, `days_since_last_inspection`) provided the largest performance improvement**. This demonstrates:
- Domain knowledge is invaluable
- Temporal patterns are highly predictive
- Feature engineering can outperform adding more raw features

### 2. Class Imbalance Requires Special Handling

**Key Learnings**:
- High accuracy can be misleading with imbalanced data
- SMOTE and class weights both have value, but work differently
- Different models respond differently to imbalance techniques
- XGBoost benefited most from SMOTE, while Random Forest worked well with class weights

### 3. Geographic Features Add Value

**Adding ZIPCODE, NTA, and Community Board**:
- Provided neighborhood-level context
- Captured unobserved factors (socioeconomic, regulatory)
- Low risk of data leakage
- Easy to obtain for predictions

### 4. Data Leakage Prevention is Essential

**Critical Practices**:
- Grouped train/test split (by restaurant ID) prevents restaurant leakage
- History features created BEFORE filtering and splitting
- Chronological ordering ensures proper temporal relationships
- Only past information used in feature creation

### 5. Model Diversity Provides Insights

**Four Different Approaches**:
- Logistic Regression: Interpretable baseline
- Random Forest: Robust ensemble
- XGBoost: High-performance gradient boosting
- CatBoost: Categorical specialist with imbalance handling

Each model provided different insights and validated findings across approaches.

### 6. SMOTE vs. Class Weights: Context Matters

**SMOTE Advantages**:
- Creates synthetic examples, helping models learn decision boundaries
- Particularly effective for XGBoost
- Better for learning minority class patterns

**Class Weight Advantages**:
- Simpler, no data augmentation
- Works well for Random Forest
- Less risk of overfitting to synthetic samples

**Best Practice**: Test both approaches and choose based on model and problem characteristics.

### 7. CatBoost's Unique Advantages

**Why CatBoost Excelled**:
- Native categorical handling (no one-hot encoding)
- Built-in class imbalance support
- Target-based encoding preserves more information
- Gentle class weights avoided overcorrection

### 8. The Power of Temporal Features

**Restaurant inspection history is highly predictive**:
- Previous grade is strongly correlated with current grade
- Inspection frequency and timing matter
- Restaurant-specific patterns exist and are learnable

## Technical Implementation Highlights

### Preprocessing Pipeline

1. **Restaurant History Features** (created first, before any filtering)
2. **Data Cleaning** (duplicates, missing values, date conversion)
3. **Feature Extraction** (year, month from dates)
4. **Train-Test Split** (grouped by restaurant ID)
5. **Categorical Encoding** (One-Hot for most models, native for CatBoost)
6. **SMOTE Upsampling** (optional, for comparison)

### Model Training

- **Class Weight Models**: Trained on original imbalanced data with adjusted weights
- **SMOTE Models**: Trained on balanced, upsampled data
- **Evaluation**: Both train and test metrics reported
- **Diagnostics**: Confusion matrices, per-class metrics, feature importance

### Evaluation Metrics

- **Accuracy**: Overall correctness
- **Precision, Recall, F1-Score**: Per-class and weighted averages
- **Confusion Matrices**: Visual representation of predictions
- **Feature Importance**: Understanding what drives predictions
